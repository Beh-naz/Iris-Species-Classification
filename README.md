# Iris-Species-Classification
This project focuses on the classification of Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using various machine learning models. Through detailed data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation, we aim to predict the species of Iris flowers based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset
data.csv: The dataset file containing Iris species and their features is uploaded to this repository.

## Libraries Used
Python
Pandas, for data manipulation
NumPy, for numerical computations
Matplotlib and Seaborn, for data visualization
Scikit-learn, for model building and evaluation
