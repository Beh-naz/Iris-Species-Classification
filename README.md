# Iris-Species-Classification
This project focuses on the classification of Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using various machine learning models. Through detailed data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation, we aim to predict the species of Iris flowers based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
