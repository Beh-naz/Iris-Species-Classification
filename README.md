# Iris-Species-Classification
This project focuses on the classification of Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using various machine learning models. Through detailed data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation, we aim to predict the species of Iris flowers based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset
[data.csv](https://github.com/Beh-naz/Iris-Species-Classification/blob/main/data.csv): The dataset file containing Iris species and their features is uploaded to this repository.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas, for data manipulation
* NumPy, for numerical computations
* Matplotlib and Seaborn, for data visualization
* Scikit-learn, for model building and evaluation

## Key Highlights

* Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand data distribution and inter-feature relationships in the folder [Visualisations](https://github.com/Beh-naz/Iris-Species-Classification/tree/main/Visualisations).

* Implementation of machine learning classifiers:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Bagging
- Gradient Boosting

* Evaluation of models based on accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) metrics.
  
* Visualization of decision boundaries in Decision Tree and Random Forest to understand the classification performance in a 2D feature space.

## Conclusion 

The models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the Iris species, with most classifiers achieving around 99% accuracy. The Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, in particular, showed significant promise in correctly classifying the Iris species based on the given features.
